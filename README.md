# Theater-DB-Design-Seamless-Normalization-and-Queries
Normalized theater database design with separate tables for shows, customers, tickets, and performances. Utilized primary and foreign keys for seamless relationships. 1NF and 3NF techniques optimized data organization. Fine-tuned for robustness and scalability, empowering data-driven decisions and enhanced experiences.

**Theater Database Normalization Project - Readme**

**Project Overview:**
The Theater Database Normalization project aims to design a sophisticated database system for a theater, focusing on data normalization. The goal is to eliminate redundancy and ensure optimal data organization, facilitating seamless data management and retrieval.

**Features:**
- Separate Tables: Data is divided into distinct tables for shows, customers, tickets, and performances, ensuring efficient organization.
- Seamless Relationships: Utilizing primary and foreign keys, relationships between tables are established, preserving data integrity.
- Normalization Techniques: Applying 1NF and 3NF techniques optimizes data structure and enhances overall performance.
- Robust Design: The database design is fine-tuned for scalability and reliability, supporting the theater's growth.

**Getting Started:**
1. Install required dependencies, including the database management system (DBMS) and Python libraries.
2. Import theater data into the database.
3. Execute Python scripts for data normalization and database schema design.
4. Test data retrieval queries and validate data consistency.
